# About

*Octocompare* is a collection of varius implementations of a simple activity tracker application
meant to ease comparison and offer the ability to reason about pros and cons of each approach. 
The concept is simmilar to [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) but extends to all aspects of web development
and multiple programming languages.
